## [2026-07-23] Refactor scraper to use requests and BeautifulSoup
Files changed:
- requirements.txt
- nixpacks.toml
- main.py
- test_scraper.py
Reason:
The camoufox headless browser caused heavy OS dependency issues and crashes on Railway. Replaced it with a lightweight HTTP requests-based scraper.
